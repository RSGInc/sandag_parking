outputs:

  # imputed_parking_costs: "./output/imputed_parking_costs.csv"     # Output from imputation and also input to district creation
  # district_data: "./output/district_data.csv"                     # Output from district creation and also input to aggregation
  # aggregated_street_data: "./output/aggregated_street_data.csv"   # Output from network data aggregation and input to space estimation
  # estimated_spaces_data: "./output/estimated_spaces.csv"          # Output from space estimation

# Which models to run, comment out any that you wish to not run. 
# However, be sure that the input is ready for whatever the new first model is.
# For example, if you have parking data cleaned up already, it can be fed into the 'create_districts' model.
# Or if you manually estimated spaces, you can skip that model too.
